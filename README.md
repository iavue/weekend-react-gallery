# React Gallery

## Description

Duration: 2 days

I developed this app to show a small gallery of my life. There are pictures of people/pets/places/things that are important to me. 

## Screen Shot

Show description of picture by clicking on a picture:
![Gallery of my Life Description](/wireframes/gallery-of-my-life-description.png "Gallery of my Life w/ description on click")

While viewing pictures, a user can click the 'heart' button to express their likes and the like count will update. 
Users can also click on each picture to view the description of each picture.
